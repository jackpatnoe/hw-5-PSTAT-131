## Elastic Net Tuning

For this assignment, we will be working with the file `"pokemon.csv"`, found in `/data`. The file is from Kaggle: <https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon>.

The [Pokémon](https://www.pokemon.com/us/) franchise encompasses video games, TV shows, movies, books, and a card game. This data set was drawn from the video game series and contains statistics about 721 Pokémon, or "pocket monsters." In Pokémon games, the user plays as a trainer who collects, trades, and battles Pokémon to (a) collect all the Pokémon and (b) become the champion Pokémon trainer.

Each Pokémon has a [primary type](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Type) (some even have secondary types). Based on their type, a Pokémon is strong against some types, and vulnerable to others. (Think rock, paper, scissors.) A Fire-type Pokémon, for example, is vulnerable to Water-type Pokémon, but strong against Grass-type.

The goal of this assignment is to build a statistical learning model that can predict the **primary type** of a Pokémon based on its generation, legendary status, and six battle statistics.

Read in the file and familiarize yourself with the variables using `pokemon_codebook.txt`.

```{r}

Pokemon <- read.csv('/Users/jackpatnoe/Desktop/pokemon.csv')



```

### Exercise 1

Install and load the `janitor` package. Use its `clean_names()` function on the Pokémon data, and save the results to work with for the rest of the assignment. What happened to the data? Why do you think `clean_names()` is useful?

First, we will use the janitor package to use clean names and make it apply to our new Pokemon variable. 

```{r}

library(janitor)
Pokemon <- clean_names(Pokemon)
```

The data now has a universally form of underscores that replace dots or spaces.It is also all in lowercase. So Something that is called "Type 1" will now be "type_1". 

I think this is useful because everything is in the same form, so we can work with the data easier. 

### Exercise 2

Using the entire data set, create a bar chart of the outcome variable, `type_1`.

How many classes of the outcome are there? Are there any Pokémon types with very few Pokémon? If so, which ones?

For this assignment, we'll handle the rarer classes by simply filtering them out. Filter the entire data set to contain only Pokémon whose `type_1` is Bug, Fire, Grass, Normal, Water, or Psychic.

After filtering, convert `type_1` and `legendary` to factors.


First we can create the Barplot: 
```{r, echo = TRUE}

ggplot(Pokemon) + geom_bar(aes(x = type_1), color = 'red', fill = 'red')


```
Observing our bar plot, we see there are 18 classes of type 1 pokemon. The pokemon types with very few type 1 classes are flying and fairy. Flying pokemon have the least.


Now we can filter out all of the pokemon that are not Bug, Fire, Grass, Normal, Water, or Psychic: 

```{r}
Pokemon <- Pokemon %>% filter(type_1 == "Bug" |
                                type_1 == "Fire" |
                                type_1 == "Grass" |
                                type_1 == "Normal" |
                                type_1 == "Water" |
                                type_1 == "Psychic")

```

Now the last step for Excercise two is to convert type_1 & legendary to factors. 


```{r}

Pokemon$type_1 <- as.factor(Pokemon$type_1)
Pokemon$legendary <- as.factor(Pokemon$legendary)

```
### Exercise 3

Perform an initial split of the data. Stratify by the outcome variable. You can choose a proportion to use. Verify that your training and test sets have the desired number of observations.

Next, use *v*-fold cross-validation on the training set. Use 5 folds. Stratify the folds by `type_1` as well. *Hint: Look for a `strata` argument.* Why might stratifying the folds be useful?


```{r}

set.seed(1518)
Pokemon_split <- initial_split(Pokemon, prop = 0.8, strata = type_1)
Pokemon_training <- training(Pokemon_split)
Pokemon_testing <- testing(Pokemon_split)
nrow(Pokemon_training)
nrow(Pokemon_testing)


```
Now to using V- fold (5 folds with strata = type-1): 

```{r}
Pokemon_folds <- vfold_cv(Pokemon_training, v = 5, strata = type_1)
```

### Exercise 4

Set up a recipe to predict `type_1` with `legendary`, `generation`, `sp_atk`, `attack`, `speed`, `defense`, `hp`, and `sp_def`.

- Dummy-code `legendary` and `generation`;

- Center and scale all predictors.


```{r}

# setting up recipe with desired parameters: 
# Centering and Scaling all predictors as well : 


Pokemon_recipe <- recipe(type_1 ~ legendary + generation + sp_atk + attack + speed + defense + hp + sp_def, data = Pokemon) %>% 
  
  step_dummy(legendary, generation) %>%
  
  step_center(starts_with("legendary"), starts_with("generation"), sp_atk, attack, speed, defense, hp, sp_def) %>% 
  
  step_scale(starts_with("legendary"), starts_with("generation"), sp_atk, attack, speed, defense, hp, sp_def)




```

### Exercise 5

We'll be fitting and tuning an elastic net, tuning `penalty` and `mixture` (use `multinom_reg` with the `glmnet` engine).

Set up this model and workflow. Create a regular grid for `penalty` and `mixture` with 10 levels each; `mixture` should range from 0 to 1. For this assignment, we'll let `penalty` range from -5 to 5 (it's log-scaled).

How many total models will you be fitting when you fit these models to your folded data?


```{r}

Elastic_model <- multinom_reg(penalty = tune(), mixture = tune()) %>% 
  set_engine("glmnet")

Elastic_wflow <- workflow() %>% 
  add_model(Elastic_model) %>% 
  add_recipe(Pokemon_recipe)

Elastic_grid <- grid_regular(penalty(range = c(-5, 5)), mixture(range = c(0, 1)), levels = c(10, 10))
                             

```

There are 100 total models that we will be fitting. 


### Exercise 6

Fit the models to your folded data using `tune_grid()`.

Use `autoplot()` on the results. What do you notice? Do larger or smaller values of `penalty` and `mixture` produce better accuracy and ROC AUC?


First we will use tune_grid to fit our models the folded data: 

```{r}
Tune_elastic <- tune_grid(Elastic_wflow,
                          resamples = Pokemon_folds,
                          grid = Elastic_grid)

```

Now we can use the autolot for the results: 

```{r, echo = TRUE}

autoplot(Tune_elastic)

```
Based off of the results, it appears smaller values of penalty and mixture produce a higher accuracy and ROC AUC. There is a sharp decline and then the Accuracy and ROC AUC becomes very low. 


### Exercise 7

Use `select_best()` to choose the model that has the optimal `roc_auc`. Then use `finalize_workflow()`, `fit()`, and `augment()` to fit the model to the training set and evaluate its performance on the testing set.

```{r, echo = TRUE}

Lowest_Auc <- select_best(Tune_elastic, metric = "roc_auc")

Final_Workflow <- finalize_workflow(Elastic_wflow, Lowest_Auc)

Pokemon_fit <- fit(Final_Workflow, Pokemon_training)

augment(Pokemon_fit, new_data = Pokemon_testing) %>% 
  accuracy(truth = type_1, estimate = .pred_class)


```

### Exercise 8

Calculate the overall ROC AUC on the testing set.

Then create plots of the different ROC curves, one per level of the outcome. Also make a heat map of the confusion matrix.

What do you notice? How did your model do? Which Pokemon types is the model best at predicting, and which is it worst at? Do you have any ideas why this might be?



```{r}

Prediction <- augment(Pokemon_fit, new_data = Pokemon_testing) %>%
    select(type_1, .pred_class, .pred_Bug, .pred_Fire, .pred_Grass,
           .pred_Normal, .pred_Psychic, .pred_Water)



accuracy(Prediction, type_1, .pred_class)


```

```{r}

roc_aunp(Prediction, type_1, .pred_Bug:.pred_Water)


```

```{r}


roc_auc(Prediction, type_1, .pred_Bug, .pred_Fire, .pred_Grass, 
        .pred_Normal, .pred_Psychic, .pred_Water, estimator = "macro_weighted")
```

```{r}

Prediction %>% 
  roc_curve(type_1, .pred_Bug, .pred_Fire, .pred_Grass, .pred_Normal, 
            .pred_Psychic, .pred_Water) %>% 
  autoplot()

```

```{r}


Prediction %>% 
  conf_mat(type_1, .pred_class) %>% 
  autoplot(type = "heatmap")
```
Summary: The ROC AUC is not very strong, so the overall strength of this model is not the best. The Pokemon that this model predicts the best are the water and normal. The Pokemon that the model predicts the worst are grass and fire. I think the different pokemons the model predicts, and their respective accuracies, depend a lot on the fact that some types of pokemon have a lot more observations than others.
